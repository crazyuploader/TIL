# Set Unlimited Bash History

Sometimes, having limited Bash history isn't enough, and so we can just it unlimited!

## Setting HISTSIZE & HISTFILESIZE in `~/.bashrc` File

We can set `HISTSIZE` & `HISTFILESIZE` variables of Bash to `-1` in `~/.bashrc` file -

```code
HISTSIZE=-1
HISTFILESIZE=-1
```
