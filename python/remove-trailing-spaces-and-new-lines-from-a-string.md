# Remove Trailing Spaces And New Lines From A String

We can use string function `strip` to remove trailing spaces and new lines from a string.

## Example

```python
>>> "Hello World!  ".strip()
'Hello World!'
```

**Note:-** We can also use `rstrip` and `lstrip` to remove spaces/new lines from left or right side of the string accordingly.
